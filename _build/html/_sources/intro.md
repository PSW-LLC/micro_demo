# Welcome to PhD2Industry RoadMap

Our venture offers a unique academia-to-industry mapping service, unveiling unanticipated career paths connected through transferable skills, alongside a detailed summary of weighted skill sets derived from job posts.

## Problem We've Seen

Our solution addresses the career development challenges faced by the 80, 000 PhD graduates from US universities annually. Only 0.45% of the PhD graduates become faculty directly. The graduates going for industry jobs often lack clear non-academic career pathways and are unaware of the diverse job opportunities suited to their expertise. Predominantly, due to limited exposure and transparency in the job market, they gravitate towards well-known sectors like CS and finance. We identified this niche problem as our focus, recognizing the untapped potential of these highly skilled individuals. Our platform introduces a novel approach by visualizing career possibilities, providing tailored job mappings, and highlighting skill set requirements. This not only enhances job market transparency but also diversifies career options for these graduates, steering them towards fulfilling roles that match their specialized skills and academic backgrounds.

## Our Solution
We offer a comprehensive platform designed to empower individuals in their career journey. Our services include:
- Career Mapping:
    - Users input their major or skills.
    - Our platform generates a visualized Sankey diagram, mapping out possible job positions suitable for individuals after graduation.
- Job Recommendations:
    - Based on career mapping results, users receive personalized job role recommendations.
    - Each recommendation is accompanied by relevant job posts, providing insights into E-Verify status and H1B numbers for companies associated with the recommended roles.
- Skill Set Analysis:
    - We analyze and present weighted skill sets derived from filtered job posts for each recommended role.
    - Users gain valuable insights into the most critical skills required for specific job roles.
- Community Forum:
    - Our platform features a community forum where users can engage in discussions related to self-growth, personal connections, and other relevant topics.
    - This forum serves as a collaborative space for users to share experiences and insights, fostering a supportive community.
Our goal is to provide users with a holistic and data-driven approach to navigate their career paths effectively, offering personalized recommendations, job insights, skill analysis, and a community platform for continuous growth and connection.

## Our Target:
In response to your question about customer or user interactions and feedback incorporation into our product/service, we have observed several key insights, particularly from international students and PhD holders. Firstly, we found that many international students lack a clear understanding of the skill sets required for various career paths. This uncertainty often channels them towards more transparent and conventional career choices, such as computer science or consulting.
Additionally, our interactions revealed that PhD programs often equip candidates with skills that may not directly align with the requirements of intermediate- or senior-level jobs in traditional fields. This situation often results in PhD holders being perceived as overqualified for entry-level positions but not sufficiently experienced for intermediate or senior roles.
Recognizing these challenges, we are committed to developing a clear roadmap that can enhance the confidence of students and young professionals in pursuing career paths that require long-term training, yet are less publicly known. To achieve this, we have outlined several steps:
- Conducting a survey among the UIUC PhD WeChat group, Redbook, Twitter, and Instagram communities. This will help us gather firsthand insights and feedback on the needs and aspirations of our target audience.
- Engaging with employers in industries that are experiencing a talent outflow. By understanding their challenges in attracting talent, we can better tailor our program to bridge the gap between skilled professionals and the industries that need them.
- Furthermore, we plan to engage with educational institutions directly. An immediate action item is to draft a proposal and reach out to the graduate college to explore potential collaboration or sponsorship opportunities. This step is crucial in ensuring that our program is not only effective but also accessible to students who need it most.
As for attracting initial users, our strategy is two-pronged: leveraging social media platforms for wider visibility and engaging directly with academic institutions for credibility and targeted outreach. By combining these approaches, we aim to build a robust user base and create a program that genuinely addresses the needs of international students and the industries they aspire to join.

## Why we can solve the problem:

Our team, with founders who intimately understand the challenges of graduate students solving state-of-the-edge problems seeking jobs in traditional industries, is uniquely positioned to address the flaws in existing job posting sites. Leveraging our expertise in data visualization and platform development, we are poised to deliver a tailored solution that effectively meets the needs of job seekers.
